The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the LORD\u2019s house. <span data-number=\"16\" class=\"v\">16</span>They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites. <span data-number=\"17\" class=\"v\">17</span>For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to the LORD. <span data-number=\"18\" class=\"v\">18</span>For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover other than the way it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, \u201cMay the good the LORD pardon everyone <span data-number=\"19\" class=\"v\">19</span>who sets his heart to seek God, the LORD, the God of his fathers, even if they aren\u2019t clean according to the purification of the sanctuary.\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"20\" class=\"v\">20</span>The LORD listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. <span data-number=\"21\" class=\"v\">21</span>The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness. The Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments to the LORD. <span data-number=\"22\" class=\"v\">22</span>Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of the LORD. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD, the God of their fathers.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"23\" class=\"v\">23</span>The whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days, and they kept another seven days with gladness. <span data-number=\"24\" class=\"v\">24</span>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. <span data-number=\"25\" class=\"v\">25</span>All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced. <span data-number=\"26\" class=\"v\">26</span>So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was nothing like this in Jerusalem. <span data-number=\"27\" class=\"v\">27</span>Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people. Their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.</p>"]}
