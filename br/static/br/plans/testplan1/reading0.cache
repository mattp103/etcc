So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. <span data-number=\"2\" class=\"v\">2</span>Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother\u2019s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. <span data-number=\"3\" class=\"v\">3</span>He also walked in the ways of Ahab\u2019s house, because his mother was his counsellor in acting wickedly. <span data-number=\"4\" class=\"v\">4</span>He did that which was evil in the LORD\u2019s sight, as did Ahab\u2019s house, for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction. <span data-number=\"5\" class=\"v\">5</span>He also followed their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram. <span data-number=\"6\" class=\"v\">6</span>He returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"7\" class=\"v\">7</span>Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram; for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off Ahab\u2019s house. <span data-number=\"8\" class=\"v\">8</span>When Jehu was executing judgement on Ahab\u2019s house, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, serving Ahaziah, and killed them. <span data-number=\"9\" class=\"v\">9</span>He sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and killed him; and they buried him, for they said, \u201cHe is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.\u201d The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"10\" class=\"v\">10</span>Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah. <span data-number=\"11\" class=\"v\">11</span>But Jehoshabeath, the king\u2019s daughter, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stealthily rescued him from amongst the king\u2019s sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she didn\u2019t kill him. <span data-number=\"12\" class=\"v\">12</span>He was with them hidden in God\u2019s house six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"1\" class=\"v\">1</span>In the seventh year, Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into a covenant with him. <span data-number=\"2\" class=\"v\">2</span>They went around in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers\u2019 households of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. <span data-number=\"3\" class=\"v\">3</span>All the assembly made a covenant with the king in God\u2019s house. He said to them, \u201cBehold, the king\u2019s son must reign, as the LORD has spoken concerning the sons of David. <span data-number=\"4\" class=\"v\">4</span>This is the thing that you must do. A third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be gatekeepers of the thresholds. <span data-number=\"5\" class=\"v\">5</span>A third part shall be at the king\u2019s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation. All the people will be in the courts of the LORD\u2019s house. <span data-number=\"6\" class=\"v\">6</span>But let no one come into the LORD\u2019s house, except the priests and those who minister of the Levites. They shall come in, for they are holy, but all the people shall follow the LORD\u2019s instructions. <span data-number=\"7\" class=\"v\">7</span>The Levites shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand. Whoever comes into the house, let him be slain. Be with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out.\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"8\" class=\"v\">8</span>So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest didn\u2019t dismiss the shift. <span data-number=\"9\" class=\"v\">9</span>Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David\u2019s, which were in God\u2019s house. <span data-number=\"10\" class=\"v\">10</span>He set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, near the altar and the house, around the king. <span data-number=\"11\" class=\"v\">11</span>Then they brought out the king\u2019s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant, and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and they said, \u201cLong live the king!\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"12\" class=\"v\">12</span>When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the LORD\u2019s house. <span data-number=\"13\" class=\"v\">13</span>Then she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king. All the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. The singers also played musical instruments, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, \u201cTreason! treason!\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"14\" class=\"v\">14</span>Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, \u201cBring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword.\u201d For the priest said, \u201cDon\u2019t kill her in the LORD\u2019s house.\u201d <span data-number=\"15\" class=\"v\">15</span>So they made way for her. She went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king\u2019s house; and they killed her there.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"16\" class=\"v\">16</span>Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, all the people, and the king, that they should be the LORD\u2019s people. <span data-number=\"17\" class=\"v\">17</span>All the people went to the house of Baal, broke it down, broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. <span data-number=\"18\" class=\"v\">18</span>Jehoiada appointed the officers of the LORD\u2019s house under the hand of the Levitical priests, whom David had distributed in the LORD\u2019s house, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as David had ordered. <span data-number=\"19\" class=\"v\">19</span>He set the gatekeepers at the gates of the LORD\u2019s house, that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in. <span data-number=\"20\" class=\"v\">20</span>He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the LORD\u2019s house. They came through the upper gate to the king\u2019s house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom. <span data-number=\"21\" class=\"v\">21</span>So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. They had slain Athaliah with the sword.</p>"]}
