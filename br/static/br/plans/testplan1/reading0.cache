His mother\u2019s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. <span data-number=\"2\" class=\"v\">2</span>He did that which was right in the LORD\u2019s eyes, according to all that his father Uzziah had done. However he didn\u2019t enter into the LORD\u2019s temple. The people still acted corruptly. <span data-number=\"3\" class=\"v\">3</span>He built the upper gate of the LORD\u2019s house, and he built much on the wall of Ophel. <span data-number=\"4\" class=\"v\">4</span>Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers. <span data-number=\"5\" class=\"v\">5</span>He also fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand cors of barley. The children of Ammon also gave that much to him in the second year, and in the third. <span data-number=\"6\" class=\"v\">6</span>So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God. <span data-number=\"7\" class=\"v\">7</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. <span data-number=\"8\" class=\"v\">8</span>He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. <span data-number=\"9\" class=\"v\">9</span>Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David\u2019s city; and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"1\" class=\"v\">1</span>Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He didn\u2019t do that which was right in the LORD\u2019s eyes, like David his father, <span data-number=\"2\" class=\"v\">2</span>but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also made molten images for the Baals. <span data-number=\"3\" class=\"v\">3</span>Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. <span data-number=\"4\" class=\"v\">4</span>He sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"5\" class=\"v\">5</span>Therefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria. They struck him, and carried away from him a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. He was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with a great slaughter. <span data-number=\"6\" class=\"v\">6</span>For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. <span data-number=\"7\" class=\"v\">7</span>Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king\u2019s son, Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king. <span data-number=\"8\" class=\"v\">8</span>The children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much plunder from them, and brought the plunder to Samaria. <span data-number=\"9\" class=\"v\">9</span>But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, \u201cBehold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven. <span data-number=\"10\" class=\"v\">10</span>Now you intend to degrade the children of Judah and Jerusalem as male and female slaves for yourselves. Aren\u2019t there even with you trespasses of your own against the LORD your God? <span data-number=\"11\" class=\"v\">11</span>Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives that you have taken captive from your brothers, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is on you.\u201d <span data-number=\"12\" class=\"v\">12</span>Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war, <span data-number=\"13\" class=\"v\">13</span>and said to them, \u201cYou must not bring in the captives here, for you intend that which will bring on us a trespass against the LORD, to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"14\" class=\"v\">14</span>So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the princes and all the assembly. <span data-number=\"15\" class=\"v\">15</span>The men who have been mentioned by name rose up and took the captives, and with the plunder clothed all who were naked amongst them, dressed them, gave them sandals, and gave them something to eat and to drink, anointed them, carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"16\" class=\"v\">16</span>At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him. <span data-number=\"17\" class=\"v\">17</span>For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and carried away captives. <span data-number=\"18\" class=\"v\">18</span>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and also Gimzo and its villages; and they lived there. <span data-number=\"19\" class=\"v\">19</span>For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, because he acted without restraint in Judah and trespassed severely against the LORD. <span data-number=\"20\" class=\"v\">20</span>Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and gave him trouble, but didn\u2019t strengthen him. <span data-number=\"21\" class=\"v\">21</span>For Ahaz took away a portion out of the LORD\u2019s house, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria; but it didn\u2019t help him.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"22\" class=\"v\">22</span>In the time of his distress, he trespassed yet more against the LORD, this same king Ahaz. <span data-number=\"23\" class=\"v\">23</span>For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him. He said, \u201cBecause the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, so I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me.\u201d But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. <span data-number=\"24\" class=\"v\">24</span>Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God\u2019s house, and cut the vessels of God\u2019s house in pieces, and shut up the doors of the LORD\u2019s house; and he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. <span data-number=\"25\" class=\"v\">25</span>In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers, to anger.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"26\" class=\"v\">26</span>Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. <span data-number=\"27\" class=\"v\">27</span>Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem, because they didn\u2019t bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.</p>"]}
