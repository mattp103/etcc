The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him. <span data-number=\"2\" class=\"v\">2</span>He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit. <span data-number=\"3\" class=\"v\">3</span>Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. <span data-number=\"4\" class=\"v\">4</span>They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don\u2019t have God\u2019s seal on their foreheads. <span data-number=\"5\" class=\"v\">5</span>They were given power, not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a person. <span data-number=\"6\" class=\"v\">6</span>In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them. <span data-number=\"7\" class=\"v\">7</span>The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people\u2019s faces. <span data-number=\"8\" class=\"v\">8</span>They had hair like women\u2019s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions. <span data-number=\"9\" class=\"v\">9</span>They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war. <span data-number=\"10\" class=\"v\">10</span>They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months. <span data-number=\"11\" class=\"v\">11</span>They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is \u201cAbaddon\u201d, but in Greek, he has the name \u201cApollyon\u201d.<span data-number=\"12\" class=\"v\">12</span>The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"13\" class=\"v\">13</span>The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God, <span data-number=\"14\" class=\"v\">14</span>saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, \u201cFree the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"15\" class=\"v\">15</span>The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind. <span data-number=\"16\" class=\"v\">16</span>The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million. I heard the number of them. <span data-number=\"17\" class=\"v\">17</span>Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulphur yellow; and the horses\u2019 heads resembled lions\u2019 heads. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulphur. <span data-number=\"18\" class=\"v\">18</span>By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulphur, which proceeded out of their mouths. <span data-number=\"19\" class=\"v\">19</span>For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm. <span data-number=\"20\" class=\"v\">20</span>The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn\u2019t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn\u2019t worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can\u2019t see, hear, or walk. <span data-number=\"21\" class=\"v\">21</span>They didn\u2019t repent of their murders, their sorceries, their sexual immorality, or their thefts.</p>"]}
