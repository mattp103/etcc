A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire. <span data-number=\"2\" class=\"v\">2</span>He had in his hand a little open book. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land. <span data-number=\"3\" class=\"v\">3</span>He cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. When he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices. <span data-number=\"4\" class=\"v\">4</span>When the seven thunders sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from the sky saying, \u201cSeal up the things which the seven thunders said, and don\u2019t write them.\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"5\" class=\"v\">5</span>The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky, <span data-number=\"6\" class=\"v\">6</span>and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be delay, <span data-number=\"7\" class=\"v\">7</span>but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as he declared to his servants, the prophets. <span data-number=\"8\" class=\"v\">8</span>The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me, said, \u201cGo, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"9\" class=\"v\">9</span>I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book.</p><p class=\"p\">He said to me, \u201cTake it, and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"10\" class=\"v\">10</span>I took the little book out of the angel\u2019s hand, and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. <span data-number=\"11\" class=\"v\">11</span>They told me, \u201cYou must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.\u201d</p>"]}
