{"REV 14": ["PUBLIC DOMAIN. \"World English Bible\" is trademark of eBible.org.", "Revelation 14:1-20", "<p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"1\" class=\"v\">1</span>I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him a number, one hundred and forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads. <span data-number=\"2\" class=\"v\">2</span>I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps. <span data-number=\"3\" class=\"v\">3</span>They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth. <span data-number=\"4\" class=\"v\">4</span>These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from amongst men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb. <span data-number=\"5\" class=\"v\">5</span>In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"6\" class=\"v\">6</span>I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people. <span data-number=\"7\" class=\"v\">7</span>He said with a loud voice, \u201cFear the Lord, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgement has come. Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"8\" class=\"v\">8</span>Another, a second angel, followed, saying, \u201cBabylon the great has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality.\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"9\" class=\"v\">9</span>Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, \u201cIf anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand, <span data-number=\"10\" class=\"v\">10</span>he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. <span data-number=\"11\" class=\"v\">11</span>The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name. <span data-number=\"12\" class=\"v\">12</span>Here is the perseverance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"13\" class=\"v\">13</span>I heard a voice from heaven saying, \u201cWrite, \u2018Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"p\">\u201cYes,\u201d says the Spirit, \u201cthat they may rest from their labours; for their works follow with them.\u201d</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"14\" class=\"v\">14</span>I looked, and saw a white cloud, and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. <span data-number=\"15\" class=\"v\">15</span>Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, \u201cSend your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!\u201d <span data-number=\"16\" class=\"v\">16</span>He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"17\" class=\"v\">17</span>Another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven. He also had a sharp sickle. <span data-number=\"18\" class=\"v\">18</span>Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, \u201cSend your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth\u2019s grapes are fully ripe!\u201d <span data-number=\"19\" class=\"v\">19</span>The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God. <span data-number=\"20\" class=\"v\">20</span>The wine press was trodden outside of the city, and blood came out of the wine press, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand and six hundred stadia.</p>"]}
